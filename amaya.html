    Amaya Espinal, a 25-year-old cardiac nurse from New York City, joined Love Island USA Season 7 as a late arrival and quickly made an impression.

            She became especially popular after singing a spontaneous, heartfelt song in the makeup room, which went viral for its sincerity and humor. Fans connected with her playful personality, supportive energy, and her now-iconic nickname, “Amaya Papaya.” Her one-liners and positive attitude made her a bright spot in the season.

        <h3 class="paragraph3">
            Amaya eventually formed a strong bond with Bryan Arenales during Casa Amor. Their connection grew naturally, leading them to win the season as the first Latino couple to take home the $100,000 prize. Their relationship continued after the show, with both expressing excitement about the future together.
