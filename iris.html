   Iris Kendall, age 25, joined Love Island USA Season 7 on Day 9 as a bombshell and influencer from Los Angeles. Prior to the show, she owned a spray‑tan business called 310 Glo and made a name for herself as a lifestyle content creator focused on fashion, beauty, and fitness. Her bold arrival and confident vibe immediately made her stand out in the villa.

           From the moment she arrived, Iris declared she wasn’t there to “play nice,” setting her sights on Jeremiah Brown and stirring drama among established couples—especially prompting tension with Huda during a kissing challenge. Her entrance upended the dynamics in the villa, and her unapologetic approach earned her both fans and critics alike

           By the finale on July 13, Iris and her final partner Pepe Garcia‑Gonzalez placed fourth overall. After the show, Iris reunited with her former partner TJ Palma off-camera for closure—but emphasized that her current connection with Pepe is “real and honest,” and they continue exploring their relationship away from cameras
