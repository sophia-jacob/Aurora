# Aurora

What it does:
It is a basic website about a few of the members of the Love Island cast. When you click on the members, you can learn more about them.

Why I made it:
I found myself to really like the love island usa show, so I figured that it would be cool to make a website about it.

How I made it:
I used HTML and CSS on Visual Studio Code. I incorporated different features like hover features and buttons.

What I struggled with:
It was a bit hard to learn how to incorporate the interactive features, especially under a time constraint as it was completed with Aurora.
